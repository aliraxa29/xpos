# Offline Mode

X POS includes a comprehensive offline-first architecture that allows full POS operation without internet connectivity, with intelligent data caching and automatic synchronization.

---

## Overview

When offline mode is enabled (`use_offline_mode` on POS Profile), X POS:
- Pre-caches all item, customer, stock, and configuration data to the browser's IndexedDB
- Continues to function fully when the internet connection is lost
- Queues invoices and purchases locally for later synchronization
- Automatically syncs all pending data when connectivity is restored

---

## Enabling Offline Mode

1. Open your POS Profile settings
2. Enable the **Use Offline Mode** option
3. Save the profile
4. Next time a shift is opened, the pre-caching process begins

---

## Data Pre-Caching

When a shift is opened with offline mode enabled, the following data is pre-loaded to your device:

### Items
- All items accessible by the POS Profile are batch-loaded (200 at a time)
- Cached data includes: item code, name, price, group, barcodes, images, tax templates
- Items are indexed for fast search by name, code, group, and barcode

### Stock Levels
- Stock availability for all items is fetched
- Cached per warehouse and item code

### Customers
- Up to 1,000 customers are pre-cached
- Indexed by name, phone, and email
- Supports offline customer search

### Item Groups
- Complete item group hierarchy is cached
- Both groups and parent groups are stored for filtering

### Configuration
- POS Profile settings (all feature flags and configurations)
- Tax templates (per item + company)
- Active offers and promotions
- Sync timestamps for incremental updates

---

## Local Database Structure

The app stores offline data in your browser with dedicated storage for:

| Storage Area | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Items | Full item catalog |
| Item Groups | Item group hierarchy |
| Customers | Customer records |
| Suppliers | Supplier records |
| Pending Invoices | Queued invoices awaiting sync |
| Pending Purchases | Queued purchases awaiting sync |
| Stock Cache | Per-item stock levels |
| Meta | Configuration, timestamps, profiles |

---

## Offline Capabilities

### Item Browsing
- Items are served from the local IndexedDB cache
- Search by name, code, group, and barcode works offline
- Stock quantities reflect the last cached values
- Item groups filtering uses cached group data

### Barcode Scanning
- Barcode lookups fall back to the cached item database
- Supports item code matching and barcode field matching
- Scale barcodes are parsed locally

### Customer Search
- Customer search uses the cached customer list
- Search by name, mobile, and email works offline
- Limited to the pre-cached 1,000 customers

### Tax Calculation
- Item tax templates are cached per item + company
- Tax calculations run entirely in the browser
- No server round-trips needed

### Invoice Creation
- Full invoices are created and validated locally
- Saved to the `pendingInvoices` queue in IndexedDB
- Includes all data: items, customer, payments, discounts, taxes, offers

### Purchase Orders
- Purchase orders can be created offline
- Saved to the `pendingPurchases` queue
- Synced when connectivity returns

---

## Automatic Sync Engine

### Periodic Sync
- Every **5 minutes**, the system performs a background sync cycle:
  - Refreshes the item cache with any new/updated items
  - Refreshes the customer cache
  - Attempts to sync pending invoices

### Online/Offline Detection
- The app monitors network connectivity via browser events
- **Online event**: Triggers immediate sync of all pending data
- **Offline event**: Activates offline mode, shows toast notification
- Visual indicators show current connectivity status

### Sync Process for Invoices
1. Pending invoices are retrieved from IndexedDB
2. Status changes to "syncing"
3. Each invoice is submitted to the server via `create_invoice` API
4. On success: invoice is removed from the queue
5. On failure: status changes to "failed", error details are stored
6. Retry logic: up to **3 retries** per invoice

### Status Tracking
Pending invoices progress through states:
- **pending** — Awaiting sync
- **syncing** — Currently being submitted
- **failed** — Submission failed (with error details)

---

## Offline Pending Panel

A dedicated dialog for managing queued offline data.

### Accessing
- Click the **Offline Pending** indicator in the POS toolbar
- Shows the count of pending items

### Panel Features
- Lists all queued offline invoices with:
  - Customer name
  - Grand total amount
  - Status badge (pending/syncing/failed)
  - Item count
  - Payment methods used
- **Sync All** button — Attempts to sync all pending invoices immediately
- **Clear All** button — Removes all pending items (with confirmation prompt)
- Per-invoice actions:
  - **Retry** — Manually retry a failed invoice
  - **Delete** — Remove a specific pending invoice

### Status Indicators
- **"Online"** — Connected and synced
- **"Offline"** — No internet connection
- **"Syncing..."** — Sync in progress
- **"{N} pending"** — Number of invoices awaiting sync

---

## Offline → Online Transition

When connectivity returns:
1. The app detects the network change event
2. A toast notification appears: "Connection restored"
3. Automatic sync begins for all pending invoices
4. Items and customers are refreshed in the background
5. Stock levels are updated to current values
6. The status indicator changes to "Online"

## Limitations in Offline Mode

| Feature | Offline Behavior |
|---|---|
| Customer creation | Not available offline (use pre-cached customers) |
| Stock updates | Uses cached stock levels (may not reflect latest) |
| Pricing changes | Uses cached prices (server price changes won't appear until sync) |
| Offers/promotions | Uses cached offers (new offers won't appear until sync) |
| Payment verification | Phone payments (M-Pesa) not available offline |
| Order history | Only online orders visible in history |
| Shift closing | Requires connectivity to close the shift |

---

## Tips

- Enable offline mode for locations with unreliable internet connectivity
- Pending invoices sync automatically when the connection is restored
- Monitor the pending count indicator in the toolbar
- You can manually force a sync when online
| `server_cache_duration` | Server cache TTL in minutes |
| `force_reload_items` | Force reload the item list (clear cache) |
| `allow_delete_offline_invoice` | Allow deleting offline-created invoices |

---

## Tips

- Enable offline mode for stores with unreliable internet connectivity
- Pre-caching occurs at shift open — expect a brief loading period for large catalogs
- Monitor the pending panel during the day to ensure invoices are syncing properly
- Failed invoices can be retried manually — check error details for troubleshooting
- Stock levels in offline mode are approximate; consider this for stock-critical businesses
- The 5-minute sync interval keeps data reasonably fresh without excessive bandwidth use
