## Stock Receiving

### Pending Receipts
The **Receive** tab shows Purchase Orders that are pending receipt for the POS warehouse.

### Receiving Process
1. Open a pending Purchase Order from the list
2. View the line items with ordered quantities
3. Enter **received quantity** per item:
   - Supports partial receipt (receive fewer items than ordered)
   - Track rejections or shortages
4. Click **Receive Stock**
5. A **Purchase Receipt** document is created in ERPNext

### Partial Receipts
- You don't have to receive all items at once
- Remaining items can be received in subsequent operations
- The PO tracks fulfilled vs. outstanding quantities

## In-Transit Stock Transfers

X POS handles incoming stock transfers from other warehouses.

### Viewing In-Transit Stock

### Handling Shortages
When received quantities don't match the transferred quantities:

- The return is sent back to the source warehouse
- Shortage quantities are tracked and documented
