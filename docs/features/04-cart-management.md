## Adding Items to the Cart

### Click to Add
- Click an item in the grid/list to add it to the cart with a quantity of 1
- Click the same item again to increment the quantity by 1
- The newly added item auto-scrolls into view with a brief highlight animation

### Stock Validation
- Before adding an item, the system checks available stock in the POS warehouse
- If the item is out of stock and `block_sale_beyond_available_qty` is enabled, an error message is shown
- Items with `allow_negative_stock` enabled (in Stock Settings) can be sold even with zero stock
- Batch items check batch-specific quantities

### Customer Requirement
- A **customer must be selected** before adding items to the cart
- If you try to add an item without selecting a customer, an error prompt appears
- The customer selection is locked during return mode

### Special Item Types
- **Serialized items** — Each serial number creates a separate cart line item
- **Batch items** — The batch selection dialog opens before adding
- **Bundle items** — Product bundle components are expanded and tracked automatically
- **Variant items** — The variant picker opens for template items
