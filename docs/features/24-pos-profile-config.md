## Configuration Tips

- Start with a minimal configuration and enable features as needed
- Test each new setting in a staging environment before enabling in production
- Use the "Allow" settings to control which operations POS operators can perform
- Configure proper accounts (expense, source, back-office) for cash movements
- Set reasonable limits on discount percentages and cash movement amounts to prevent errors
- Enable "Use Offline Mode" for locations with unreliable connectivity
- Use "Background Submissions" for high-traffic POS stations to speed up checkout
