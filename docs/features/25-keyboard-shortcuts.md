## Tips

- Barcode scanners function as keyboard input — scanned codes are typed into the focused field and auto-submitted
- Combine keyboard and mouse for optimal speed — keyboard for search/entry, mouse for selection
- The `F2` shortcut is essential for quick switching between item search and barcode scanning
- Train cashiers on `Enter` (Save & Print) vs. `Shift+Enter` (Save Only) for consistent workflow
- Use arrow keys in the payment dialog to quickly switch between Cash and Card without reaching for the mouse
